# Advanced Tree Capitator
Minecraft Tree Capitator for killing the forest more quickly :D

## Usage:
You have to select any vanilla Minecraft axe to start the system. If then aiming at any combination of natural wood blocks (logs), you'll get a white outline marking the selected area to chop down at once. The axe will lose durability for every mined block and if it breaks, the system will automatically cancel the process.

You can deactivate the system for yourself when pressing `sneak + drop_item` while holding an axe item. For activation, it's the same. It's noticable through the small message above your hotbar, also called the actionbar.

## Note:
The white outline marking the selected area of blocks uses invisible shulker boxes with a **glowing effect**. This means that the effect is not going to work for some shaders overwriting the glowing effect and/or uses other effects conflicting with it. If you want to keep using your shader, you can manually deactivate the effect using `/trigger tree.nostroke`. This will improve the performace by a lot too. For activation, use the same command as before.

## Installation:
This Datapack does not need any user interaction to get the program working.
